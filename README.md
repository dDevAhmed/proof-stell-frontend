# 🌐 ProofStell Frontend

User interface for the **ProofStell decentralized document verification platform** built on Stellar.

---

# 🌍 Overview

The **ProofStell Frontend** is the primary entry point into the ProofStell ecosystem. It enables users, institutions, and verifiers to interact with on-chain document credentials in a simple and secure way.

It abstracts blockchain complexity into a smooth user experience for:

* 📄 Document upload & verification
* 🧾 Credential issuance & management
* 🏫 Institutional credential signing
* 🔐 Wallet-based authentication (no passwords required)

All verification logic is anchored on the **Stellar blockchain via Soroban smart contracts**.

---

# 🚀 Features

## 📄 Document Verification System

Users can verify the authenticity of documents in seconds.

**Flow:**

* Upload a document (PDF, image, or text file)
* File is hashed using SHA-256 (client-side)
* Hash is sent to backend / Soroban contract
* On-chain record is checked for integrity match
* Verification result is displayed instantly

**Benefits:**

* Tamper-proof verification
* Instant authenticity check
* Fully auditable on-chain history

---

## 📊 Credential Dashboard

A unified dashboard for all wallet-linked credentials.

**Includes:**

* All issued documents tied to wallet address
* Verification status (valid / revoked / expired)
* Issuer identity (institution or organization)
* Timestamped issuance history
* On-chain transaction references

Users can easily track their digital identity footprint in the ecosystem.

---

## 🏫 Issuer Portal (Institutions)

For verified organizations issuing credentials.

**Capabilities:**

* Issue digital certificates or documents
* Link credentials to wallet addresses
* Revoke or update credentials (if authorized)
* View issuance history and analytics
* Batch issue credentials for multiple users

This transforms institutions into **on-chain trusted issuers**.

---

## 🔐 Wallet Authentication (Stellar Native)

Authentication is fully decentralized.

**Supported Wallets:**

* Freighter Wallet
* Stellar xBull (optional extension support)

**Features:**

* No email/password system
* Signature-based login (SEP-0010 standard)
* Session validation via wallet signature
* Secure wallet identity binding

---

## 🧾 Credential Viewer

Each credential includes:

* Document hash
* Issuer information
* Issuance timestamp
* Verification status
* Blockchain transaction reference
* Optional metadata (course, institution, certification type)

---

## 🔎 Verification Explorer

Public-facing verification tool:

* Paste document hash or upload file
* Instantly check blockchain record
* View issuer authenticity
* Audit credential lifecycle

# 🔁 How It Works

### 📄 Document Verification Flow

1. User uploads a document
2. Frontend generates cryptographic hash
3. Hash is sent to backend API
4. Backend checks Soroban smart contract
5. Contract returns match / mismatch
6. UI displays verification result

---

### 🏫 Credential Issuance Flow

1. Institution logs in via wallet
2. Uploads credential metadata
3. Backend stores IPFS / metadata hash
4. Soroban contract records issuance
5. Credential becomes publicly verifiable

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 2. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 3. Open Application

```
http://localhost:3000
```

# 🔐 Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values. The project validates environment variables at build time and will fail the build when required values are missing or malformed.

Minimum required values (see `.env.example`):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_HORIZON_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROOFSTELL_CONTRACT_ID`

Optional but useful:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ISSUER_CONTRACT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROVIDERS` (comma-separated providers like `freighter,xbull`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`

Example:

```env
# copy .env.example -> .env.local and edit
```
